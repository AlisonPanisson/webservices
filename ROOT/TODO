TO DO:
--> Extract the provenance of analysis from the JSON and store it in the database (where???)
--> Decide on the annotations of nodes (right now they are represented as strings in the database)
--> Build the logics of sessions in code ***WILL REQUIRE TYING THIS WEB SERVICE TO THE FRONT-END***

Alice needs to:
--> Put the provenance of nodes in the Nodes table
--> Call the methods which create my tables in the INFO web service since all tables are created there
